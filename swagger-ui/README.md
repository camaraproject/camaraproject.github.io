# camaraproject.github.io/swagger-ui	

A fork of Swagger UI [r5.22.0](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases/tag/v5.22.0) (21st May 2025) to display CAMARA API definition files (YAML) in a user friendly way.

## Notes for editors

The latest Swagger UI release can be found [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases/latest).

swagger-initializer.js has been adapted to reject rendering of any YAML files that are outside the
CAMARA project.

User Interface can be edited at swagger-ui.css.
